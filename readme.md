#### Problem

I want to create a [suite of tests](https://github.com/kevinhodges/jest-test/blob/master/test/helper.js) that can be executed from a [number of contexts](https://github.com/kevinhodges/jest-test/blob/master/test/index.test.js). Each context however needs to [build a variable](https://github.com/kevinhodges/jest-test/blob/master/test/index.test.js#L12) and pass it to the test suite. Is that possible?
